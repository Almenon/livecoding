# livecoding

**[livecoding](http://livecoding.io/)** is an interactive sketchpad. Code modifications are instantly displayed - no need to refresh your browser. Click a number, adjust its value via the popup slider, and watch your work change on the fly!

100% totally based on Bret Victor's [Inventing on Principle](https://vimeo.com/36579366) talk, which is one of the best I've ever seen. If you watch only one talk this year, make sure it's this one.
